  <h1>Markets for Traders<br/>Mechanism-First Trading Architectures</h1>

  <p class="subtitle">
    This sub-collection is one of the <strong>three pillars</strong> of a broader professional training program for
    algorithmic trading. It is <strong>explicitly not about finding alpha</strong>.
    Its purpose is to train practitioners to design, reason about, and implement
    <strong>operationally sound trading architectures</strong> that remain coherent under
    execution costs, liquidity constraints, regime shifts, and funding stress.

    <strong>Explicit premise:</strong> Markets are not price series.
    They are constraint-driven systems where liquidity, funding, execution,
    and regime dependence dominate realized outcomes.

  <h2>The Two-Book Sequence</h2>

  <p>
    The pillar is designed to be read and used <strong>in order</strong>.
    The first book rebuilds intuition. The second forces execution.
    Neither book claims to close the gap between models and markets —
    that gap is named, revisited, and treated as a first-class object.

      <h3>Book I — The ABC of Trading</h3>
      <p>
        A mechanism-first introduction to markets.
        Liquidity, carry, correlation, funding, and regime transitions are treated
        as <strong>tradable constraints</strong>, not background noise.
        No strategies. No optimization. Pure architectural literacy.

  <h2>The 10 Execution Laboratories (Colab)</h2>

  <p>
    The notebooks are not demonstrations.
    They are <strong>controlled stress environments</strong> where strategies fail
    for the same reasons they fail in institutions:
    costs accumulate, liquidity disappears, correlations compress,
    and survival constraints bind.

  <div class="reviewbox">
    <strong>Market Mechanics & Execution Pillar</strong><br/>
    <span class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</span>

    <p style="margin-top:10px;">
      This two-book sequence excels by being explicit about what it does not do.
      It does not promise alpha. It does not confuse simulation with markets.
      Instead, it trains practitioners to build trading architectures that remain
      intelligible, reviewable, and survivable under real constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      The repeated acknowledgment of the gap between models and reality is not a disclaimer
      but a pedagogical strength. Readers leave with better judgment, not false confidence.
      As a market mechanics pillar inside a broader professional curriculum,
      this collection is unusually honest and structurally sound.
