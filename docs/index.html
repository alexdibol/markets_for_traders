  <h1>Markets for Traders</h1>

  <p class="subtitle">
    Most people encounter markets through prices. Traders encounter them through constraints.
    What can be traded, in what size, under what funding, through which channels, and at what
    cost — these questions determine outcomes long before any notion of “edge” becomes relevant.
    <br/><br/>
    <strong>Markets for Traders</strong> is built around a simple but often neglected premise:
    markets are not prediction problems. They are operational systems. Prices are the visible
    surface of a deeper machinery composed of liquidity provision, balance-sheet constraints,
    execution frictions, regulatory limits, and regime-dependent behavior.
    <br/><br/>
    This pillar exists to retrain intuition. It teaches readers to stop asking
    “Is this signal good?” and start asking “Can this position survive?”
    Survival, not optimality, is the dominant objective once markets are treated honestly.
    <br/><br/>
    The collection is deliberately explicit about its limits. It does not promise alpha.
    It does not offer deployable strategies. Instead, it builds the intellectual and operational
    scaffolding required before any professional trading activity can be responsibly attempted.
  </p>

<section class="section">
  <h2>The Two-Book Architecture</h2>

  <p>
    The sequence is structured as apprenticeship rather than instruction.
    The first book establishes the grammar of market mechanics.
    The second forces the reader to operate within that grammar under stress.
    Neither stands alone.
  </p>

  <div class="grid">
    <a class="card linkcard" href="https://github.com/alexdibol/markets_for_traders/blob/main/book/ABC_OF_TRADING.pdf" target="_blank">
      <h3>Book I — The ABC of Trading</h3>
      <p>
        A conceptual foundation written for practitioners.
        Liquidity, carry, volatility, correlation, credit, and funding are introduced
        not as indicators but as economic mechanisms. The goal is literacy:
        understanding what market objects mean, how they interact, and why naive
        backtests so often mislead.
      </p>

      <h3>Book II — Markets for Traders</h3>
      <p>
        Ten mechanism-first laboratories implemented in Google Colab.
        Strategies operate on explicit curves, surfaces, and balance-sheet objects.
        Costs accumulate. Constraints bind. Regimes change.
        Failure is frequent — and instructive.
      </p>
    </a>
  </div>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Important:</strong> These books are intentionally repetitive.
    Core ideas reappear across assets and mechanisms because real trading failure
    is rarely novel — it is structural.
  </div>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>The Execution Laboratories</h2>

  <p>
    The notebooks are not demonstrations and not templates.
    They are controlled environments designed to expose fragility.
    Each laboratory forces the reader to observe how a seemingly reasonable
    position becomes untenable once execution, leverage, or regime shifts are introduced.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pedagogical objective is not success but calibration:
    understanding where models break, where intuition fails,
    and why institutional risk management dominates realized outcomes.
  </p>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Independent Assessment</h2>

  <div class="reviewbox">
    <div class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</div>
    <p>
      <strong>Evaluator:</strong> OpenAI GPT-5.2<br/>
      <strong>Nature:</strong> Independent, non-authoritative analytical opinion
    </p>

    <p>
      This collection distinguishes itself through intellectual honesty.
      It repeatedly acknowledges the gap between simplified models and real markets
      and treats that gap as the central educational object rather than an inconvenience.
      The mechanism-first framing is particularly effective in counteracting
      signal-centric thinking common in quantitative education.
    </p>

    <p>
      The integration of explicit execution costs, leverage constraints,
      and regime transitions elevates the notebooks from illustrative examples
      to genuine laboratories. They train judgment, restraint, and respect
      for market fragility — qualities rarely emphasized but essential in practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Limitations:</strong>
      This assessment is generated by a large language model.
      It is not a peer-reviewed academic evaluation, regulatory review,
      or investment due diligence. It may reflect coherence and structure
      rather than empirical validation. Readers should treat it as informed
      commentary, not evidence.
