<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<section class="hero">
  <h1>Markets for Traders</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Markets for Traders</strong> is the Market Mechanics & Execution pillar of a broader,
    governance-first curriculum for training professional algorithmic trading practitioners.
    This pillar is intentionally explicit about its limits. It does not promise alpha discovery,
    signal generation, or deployable strategies. Its purpose is structural literacy.
  </p>

  <p>
    In institutional trading environments, systems rarely fail because the underlying idea
    was incorrect. They fail because execution costs overwhelm expected returns, liquidity
    evaporates precisely when it is needed, correlations collapse across portfolios,
    funding constraints bind, and regimes shift faster than capital structures can absorb.
    These failures are not philosophical. They are mechanical.
  </p>

  <p>
    This pillar exists to confront that reality directly. The two books introduce markets
    as systems governed by tradable surfaces, constraints, and feedback loops.
    The ten companion Colab notebooks operationalize those ideas in controlled laboratories
    where costs accumulate, action spaces shrink, and survival becomes the primary objective.
  </p>

  <p>
    Governance and strategy engineering are addressed elsewhere in the collection.
    The role of this pillar is narrower and deeper: to ensure that whatever strategies
    are later proposed remain grounded in how markets actually function when conditions
    stop being benign.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Explicit positioning:</strong> This pillar teaches market mechanics and execution reality.
    It is not an alpha-seeking program. Survival dominates optimization.

  <h2>The Two Books (Primary Artifacts)</h2>

  <p>
    This pillar is anchored by two books that must be read in sequence.
    The notebooks are not substitutes for the books. The books are not complete without execution.
    Together they form a single apprenticeship unit.
  </p>

  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Book I — The ABC of Trading</h3>
      <p>
        A gentle but uncompromising introduction to market mechanisms.
        This book retrains intuition away from signals and toward constraints:
        liquidity, regimes, carry, correlation, funding, and execution.
        It establishes the vocabulary and mental models used throughout the notebooks.
      </p>
      <a href="https://github.com/alexdibol/markets_for_traders/blob/main/book/ABC_OF_TRADING.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

      </a>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Book II — Markets for Traders</h3>
      <p>
        A hands-on continuation focused on execution and stress.
        Each chapter maps directly to a Colab laboratory and explains
        how the underlying mechanism is modeled, stressed, and observed.
        This book is inseparable from the notebooks.

    <strong>Sequencing rule:</strong> Do not start the notebooks before reading Book I.
    Do not interpret notebook outcomes without Book II.

<!-- CHAPTERS + COLABS -->
<section>
  <h2>The Ten Execution Chapters & Colab Laboratories</h2>

  <div class="grid">

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 1 — Cryptos</h3>
      <p>
        Crypto markets serve as a laboratory for extreme regime behavior.
        With minimal fundamental anchors and high reflexivity, they expose
        liquidity cliffs, narrative feedback, and abrupt structural breaks.
      </p>
      <a href="https://github.com/alexdibol/markets_for_traders/blob/main/notebooks/CHAPTER%201.ipynb" target="_blank">Open Colab</a>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 2 — Oil and Commodities Trading</h3>
      <p>
        Commodities embed physical constraints into price formation.
        Storage, transport, seasonality, and geopolitics dominate returns,
        forcing reconciliation between financial abstraction and real supply.
      </p>
      <a href="https://github.com/alexdibol/markets_for_traders/blob/main/notebooks/CHAPTER%202.ipynb" target="_blank">Open Colab</a>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 3 — FX Carry Trade</h3>
      <p>
        FX carry is framed as compensation for crash risk.
        The chapter examines funding currencies, unwind dynamics,
        and the fragility of low-volatility equilibria.
      </p>
      <a href="https://github.com/alexdibol/markets_for_traders/blob/main/notebooks/CHAPTER%203.ipynb" target="_blank">Open Colab</a>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 4 — Yield Curve Dynamics</h3>
      <p>
        The yield curve is treated as a tradable surface rather than a forecast.
        Duration, convexity, curve shape, and regime-dependent transmission
        define feasible exposure.
      </p>
      <a href="https://github.com/alexdibol/markets_for_traders/blob/main/notebooks/CHAPTER%204.ipynb" target="_blank">Open Colab</a>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 5 — Credit Spreads</h3>
      <p>
        Credit spreads encode delayed volatility and jump risk.
        Hazard rates, liquidity premia, and default clustering
        dominate outcomes under stress.
      </p>
      <a href="https://github.com/alexdibol/markets_for_traders/blob/main/notebooks/CHAPTER%205.ipynb" target="_blank">Open Colab</a>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 6 — Volatility Trading</h3>
      <p>
        Volatility is treated as an asset class with carry and convexity.
        Vol-of-vol, surface dynamics, and regime breaks are central mechanisms.
      </p>
      <a href="https://github.com/alexdibol/markets_for_traders/blob/main/notebooks/CHAPTER%206.ipynb" target="_blank">Open Colab</a>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 7 — Equity Factors</h3>
      <p>
        Equity factors are analyzed as compressed macro exposures.
        Crowding, correlation spikes, and factor crashes reveal
        the fragility of diversification.
      </p>
      <a href="https://github.com/alexdibol/markets_for_traders/blob/main/notebooks/CHAPTER%207.ipynb" target="_blank">Open Colab</a>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 8 — Order Flow Mechanism</h3>
      <p>
        This chapter brings microstructure to the foreground.
        Depth, impact, inventory, and timing determine the true cost
        of changing portfolio state.
      </p>
      <a href="https://github.com/alexdibol/markets_for_traders/blob/main/notebooks/CHAPTER%208.ipynb" target="_blank">Open Colab</a>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 9 — Cross-Asset Macro Coupling</h3>
      <p>
        Cross-asset interactions are driven by funding and correlation coupling.
        Diversification collapses into shared stress channels during regime breaks.
      </p>
      <a href="https://github.com/alexdibol/markets_for_traders/blob/main/notebooks/CHAPTER%209.ipynb" target="_blank">Open Colab</a>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Chapter 10 — Cascading Stress</h3>
      <p>
        The final chapter models systemic cascades.
        Balance-sheet contagion and forced liquidation
        dominate price formation in crisis.
      </p>

<!-- EVALUATION -->
<section>
  <h2>Independent Assessment</h2>

  <div class="reviewbox">
    <div class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</div>

    <p>
      This collection stands out for its structural honesty and pedagogical restraint.
      It makes no claim to alpha generation and explicitly centers execution,
      liquidity, funding, and regime risk as the dominant determinants of realized performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The execution laboratories are particularly effective. By forcing strategies to pay costs,
      respect liquidity limits, and operate under regime shifts, the notebooks build intuition
      that historical backtests alone cannot provide. Failure is not treated as error,
      but as the primary learning signal.
