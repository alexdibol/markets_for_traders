  <!-- HERO / INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="hero">
    <h1>Markets for Traders</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Markets for Traders</strong> is the Market Mechanics & Execution pillar of a broader,
      governance-first curriculum for training professional algorithmic trading practitioners.
      This pillar is intentionally explicit about what it is <em>not</em>. It is not a promise of alpha.
      It is not a catalog of signals. It is not a shortcut to performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, this collection is designed to address the structural gap that separates most
      academic or retail trading education from institutional reality. In professional settings,
      trading strategies do not fail primarily because their ideas are wrong. They fail because
      liquidity disappears, execution costs dominate, correlations collapse, funding constraints bind,
      and regimes change faster than portfolios can adapt. These failures are mechanical, not intellectual.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two books in this sequence, together with ten tightly controlled Colab notebooks,
      train the reader to see markets as systems governed by constraints. Each chapter isolates
      a market domain and exposes the mechanisms that determine realized outcomes under stress.
      The notebooks are not optimizers. They are laboratories. Their purpose is to make failure
      visible, interpretable, and repeatable.
    </p>

    <p>
      This pillar assumes that governance and strategy engineering already exist elsewhere
      in the curriculum. Its role is narrower and deeper: to ensure that whatever strategies
      are eventually designed remain grounded in how markets actually function when conditions
      stop being benign.
    </p>

  <!-- CHAPTERS -->
  <section>
    <h2>The Ten Execution Chapters</h2>

    <div class="grid">

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Chapter 1 — Cryptos</h3>
        <p>
          Crypto markets are treated as a pure regime laboratory. With minimal fundamental anchors
          and extreme reflexivity, they expose liquidity cliffs, feedback loops, and narrative-driven
          regime shifts. This chapter trains intuition around discontinuity, not valuation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Chapter 2 — Oil and Commodities Trading</h3>
        <p>
          Commodities introduce physical constraints into financial pricing. Storage, transport,
          seasonality, and geopolitical shocks dominate return dynamics. This chapter forces the
          reader to reconcile financial models with real-world supply mechanisms.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Chapter 3 — FX Carry Trade</h3>
        <p>
          FX carry is framed as compensation for crash risk rather than free yield. The chapter
          examines funding currencies, unwind dynamics, and the structural fragility of
          low-volatility regimes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Chapter 4 — Yield Curve Dynamics</h3>
        <p>
          The yield curve is treated as a tradable surface rather than a forecasting tool.
          Duration, convexity, curve shape, and monetary regime transitions define feasible
          exposure, not directional views.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Chapter 5 — Credit Spreads</h3>
        <p>
          Credit spreads encode delayed volatility and jump risk. This chapter focuses on
          hazard rates, liquidity premia, and the non-linear behavior of spreads under stress.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Chapter 6 — Volatility Trading</h3>
        <p>
          Volatility is treated as an asset class with its own carry and convexity trade-offs.
          The chapter emphasizes volatility-of-volatility, surface dynamics, and regime breaks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Chapter 7 — Equity Factors</h3>
        <p>
          Equity factors are analyzed as compressed macro exposures. Crowding, correlation spikes,
          and factor crashes reveal how diversification erodes precisely when it is most needed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Chapter 8 — Order Flow Mechanism</h3>
        <p>
          This chapter brings microstructure to the foreground. Depth, impact, inventory, and
          execution timing define the true cost of changing portfolio state.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Chapter 9 — Cross-Asset Macro Coupling</h3>
        <p>
          Cross-asset interactions are examined through funding, correlation, and regime coupling.
          The chapter demonstrates how diversification collapses into shared stress channels.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Chapter 10 — Cascading Stress</h3>
        <p>
          The final chapter models systemic cascades. Balance-sheet contagion, forced liquidation,
          and feedback loops dominate price formation. Markets become liquidation mechanisms.
        </p>

  <!-- EVALUATION -->
  <section>
    <h2>Independent Assessment</h2>

    <div class="reviewbox">
      <div class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</div>

      <p>
        This two-book sequence represents an unusually disciplined and honest contribution to
        algorithmic trading education. Its defining strength is not novelty but restraint.
        The collection makes no claims about alpha generation and explicitly rejects the idea
        that better signals alone produce better outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, the books and notebooks train readers to recognize the structural forces that
        dominate realized performance: execution costs, liquidity collapse, regime shifts,
        correlation compression, and funding constraints. The repeated acknowledgment of the
        gap between models and real markets is not a disclaimer but a pedagogical anchor.
      </p>

      <p>
        The execution laboratories are particularly effective because they force strategies
        to fail in controlled ways. This creates intuition that cannot be acquired through
        historical backtests alone. For institutional practitioners, this posture is essential.
        Survival, not optimization, is treated as the primary objective.
